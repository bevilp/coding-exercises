    * Sort Stack
    *
    * Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional
    * temporary stack, but you may not copy elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack
    * supports the following operations: push, pop, peek and isEmpty.
