    * Animal Shelter
    *
    * An animal shlter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People
    * must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether
    * they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which
    * specific animal they would like. Create a data structure to maintain this system and implement operations such
    * as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
