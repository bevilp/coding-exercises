    * You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in addition to insert, find and delete, has a
    * method getRandomNode() which return a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be
    * chosen. Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode and explain how you would implement the rest of the
    * methods.
