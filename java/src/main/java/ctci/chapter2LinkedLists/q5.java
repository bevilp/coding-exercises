    * Sum Lists
    *
    * You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are
    * stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two
    * numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
    *
    * EXAMPLE
    * input: (7->1->6) + (5->9->2). That is, 617+295.
    * output: 2->1->9. That is, 912.
    *
    * FOLLOW UP
    * Suppos the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
    * EXAMPLE
    * input: (6->1->7) + (2->9->5). That is 617+295.
    * ouput: 9->2->1. That is, 912
